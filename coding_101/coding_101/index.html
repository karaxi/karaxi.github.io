  <h2> Mathematics is not usually liked by students.....Why?</h2>
  <ul id="List">
    <li class="math"> It's another language</li>
    <li class="math"> It doesn't make sense </li>
    <li class="math"> Too much work </li>
    <li class="math"> It is too absolute </li>

</ul>

<h2> What brought you here?</h2>

<p> If you are like me, then you love Math!
  But chances are you are not like me and want to just
  find a way to do enough to pass Math <br>
  Math is used in everything and it helps with our own reasoning ability.
  <br> Universities are interested in Mathematics
  and its grades because of the idea that if you can manage it,
  you are able to manage most majors.
